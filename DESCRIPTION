Title: A Collection of functions for similarity analysis of vegetation
        data
Author: Gerald Jurasinski <gerald.jurasinski@uni-rostock.de>, with
        contributions from Vroni Retzer <vroni.retzer@gmx.de>

Depends: R (>= 2.12.0), stats, vegan
Suggests: gplots, geoR, plotrix
Description: Besides functions for the calculation of similarity and
        multiple plot similarity measures with binary data (for
        instance presence/absence species data) the package contains
        some simple wrapper functions for reshaping species lists into
        matrices and vice versa and some other functions for further
        processing of similarity data (Mantel-like permutation
        procedures) as well as some other useful stuff for vegetation
        analysis.
