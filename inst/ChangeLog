SIMBA VERSIONS


Version 0.3-3
	
	* Bugfixes to function mps.f. Further the function is now
	named mos.f
	
	* New function mos.ft for the calculation of the (dis)similarity
	of a focal plot to the pooled surrounding plots. This, like mos.f
	represents	measures of singularity
	
	* New function CqN for the calculation of Chao et al.s probabilistic
	multiple plot similarity indices.
	
	* New function trudi for the calculation of true diversity on gamma,
	alpha and beta scale
	
	* New plotting function batonplot ---
	
	* Bug fixes and updates to pcol and all related functions (the 
	functionality of permcor and mancor is now integrated in pcol 
	and permcor2 is now mantl and does the permutations). Thus, two 
	functions pcol (doing the handling) and mantl (doing the calculations)
	remain.
	
	* Deprecated: dfcor. The functionality is easy to be achieved using 
	lapply. An example is included in the help for mantl.

Version 0.3-2

	* Added a neighbor definition possibility to rin. Now, also a number
	of k nearest neighbors can be defined.
	
	* Fixed some issues with many of the documentations especially
	for pdf.
	
	* Fixed a missing documentation: the data set bernina was undocumented.
	
	* Now gives version number when loading.

Version 0.3-1

	* rin, mps, mpd, mps.ave, mps.f, sos: A bunch of new functions
	for the calculation of multiple plot similarity coefficients with
	rin a wrapper function that allows for the application of all
	other functions in a moving window across an array of plots. 
	
	* The older functions het2nbs, sim.het, sim.pat, sim.rel, sim.relt, 
	simn, sima that provided parts of that functionality in a different 
	way, have been removed from the package.
	
	* symbol.size, new helper function. enables to easily create 
	something like bubble plots through all plot.xy methods
	
	* auc, new function for integrating the area under a curve (line)
	
	* bb2num, new function for translation of Braun-Blanquet scale 
	abundance values to cover percentages and vice versa.
	
	* simbadocs, new function to view some documentation details
	to the package
	
	* ads.fbg, new function to maximize the relation with the
	prescribed gradient and the resulting gradient when creating 
	an artificial species matrix with either ads, ads.hot or makead.

	* fixed a bug in mama that caused an error if input was not well defined.
	The function is now more robust. Updated documentation accordingly.
	
	* fixed a bug in liste that has caused an error if the input
	data.frame object had no rownames.
	
	* fixed a bug in diffslope and expanded the function. Now also the 
	difference in intercept can be calculated (function diffic). 
	(take care with resc.y!!) accordingly a print function has 
	been added.
	
	* New documentations for the new functions as well as updates
	and bug fixes to many of the existent documentations

Version 0.2-5
	
	* sim.yo, new function to create and calculate your own 
	similarity coefficient. data preparation as in sim but you
	can give your own formula.
	
	* dist.tmp, new function to calulate distance between the
	variables or instances of a data-set in time. The two recordings
	are to be given as two distinct matrices.
	
	* updating an cleaning documentation and data-sets
	
	* some functions (e.g. meanea, medea) were skipped
	
Version 0.2-4
	
	* ads.hot, new function to create artificial data-set with 
	hotpots of species richness
	
	* update to occ.time (printing methods)
	
	* com.sim, new function to compare similarities between subsets
	
	* sim: added some similarity measures (most of them found in 
	Shi 1993. the help was updated accordingly.
	
	* ads.ternaries: new data-set, which contains artificial data 
	for the construction of ternary plots to inspect the behavior 
	of the asymmetric similarity indices in sim.
	
	* updated the possibilities of neighbor definition in sim.pat,
	sim.rel, sim.het, and sim. In a addition to specifying a radius
	it is now possible to give two radiuses which define a ring
	around each plot. All other plots falling into the ring are
	considered as neighbors.
	
Version 0.2-3
	
	* sim.tmp: similarity of plots in time. all similarity indices 
	provided by sim can be used to calculate similarity not between 
	plots but between timesteps
	
	* occ.time: new function which allows to track changes in 
	species composition in time. the basic function is occ.tmp which
	is called by occ.time to calculate changes in species occurence 
	for various time steps at once.
	
	* sim.relt: significance testing for sim.rel
	
	* sim.pat: changes to underlying functions simn and sima lead
	to minor changes in sim.pat as well. sima and simn changed
	considerably and handle presence/absence data better now
	
	* sim.relt: significance testing for sim.rel
	
	* sim.rel: new function for calculating additive partitioning
	and relative similarity sensu Whittaker
	
	* sim.het: significance testing for het2nbs. Furthermore a bug in 
	the underlying function was fixed
	
Version 0.2-2
	
	* Updated and added documentation files
	
	* Some for-loops are replaced by faster apply-functions.
	
	* simdist is now obsolet. sim takes over its functionality.
	If you give geographic coordinates the geographic distances
	and related things are calculated in addition to similarities.
	
	* sim.pat: new function for calculating similarity between a 
	focal unit and its neighbours.
	
	* het2nbs: automatic calculation of mean similarity between
	a focal unit and its neighbours (including the variation in 
	the single values)
	
	* aslopect: calculate the similarity of sampling units regarding
	their aspect and slope at the same time. follows the idea, that,
	the more shallow the slope the less important are differences in
	aspect in an ecological sense

Version 0.2-1
	
	* meanea: new function for the calculation of running means, can
	be applied to vectors as well as to data.frames, subsetter must
	be given
	
	* medea: new function for the calculation of running medeans, can
	be applied to vectors as well as to data.frames, subsetter must
	be given
	
	* aslopect: calculate the similarity of sampling units regarding
	their aspect and slope at the same time. follows the idea, that,
	the more shallow the slope the less important are differences in
	aspect in an ecological sense
	
	* dfcor: calculate permuted correlation between a vector and a
	dataframe with columns each containing a vectorized similarity
	or dissimilarity matrix.
	
	* diffslope, permcor, permcor2: bug fixes
	
	* direct, direct2: results are now given as dist-object
	

Version 0.2-0

	* Rewritten documentation files
	
	* bcoov: new function for the calculation of Bray-Curtis distance
	for one variable
	
	* pcol: is now also capable of calculating permuted correlation
	of a distance matrix (or vector) against a subsetting object 
	(containing distance classes or similar). background function
	permcor was rewritten and is now faster. permcor2 and mancor are
	new written functions to handle the different possibilities of
	pcol.
	
	* diffmean: new functions to calculate the difference in mean
	and the F-value of two numeric vectors. Inference is obtained 
	by permutation.
	
	* diffmich: new function to calculate the difference in the
	parameters of Michaelis-Menten Kinetik fitted to PAM data
	
	* diffslope: calculating and testing of significance the difference
	in slope between two regressions.
	
	* The most of the functions have now print and plot methods to 
	obtain nice output and plots.
	

Version 0.1-1

	* Fixed bugs in documentation
	
	* bcoov: new function for the calculation of Bray-Curtis distance
	for one variable
	
	* pcol: calculate permuted correlation on levels or strata. The results
	are written to a data.frame which then contains for each level the 
	correlation estimate, the significance after permutation and the number
	of cases which made up the level
	
	* direct and direct2: calculation of direction classes for geographic
	coordinates with two different class-divisions. classes are fixed and
	cannot be set by the user (which might come in the future)
